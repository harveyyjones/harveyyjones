# I'm Harvey

## Mobile App Developer
I create software solutions that serve real people and solve real problems, focusing on practical applications rather than just technical exercises.

If you check my repos wou will see some of the solutions I have applied are not a good fit for industrial standards or maybe even seems absurd. As an example while I'm coding [Musee](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/musee-for-spotify/id6739033544) (approximately includes +20k lines of codes) I have never used an external library for state management (which made my colleagues laugh) as opposed to my other apps. Sometimes it is because I sometimes want to see how many things can we sacrifice following only our mind without the standards to obey or to see if we can re-set them walking in the edge. There are also apps I have which you can find in my repo written in clean code princpiples and best practices, but who doesn't?
